#jQuery Form Validation: Mint signup page

For this project, I'm updating an earlier project (on HTML5/CSS3 form design) to include jQuery form validation, as part of the Odin Project's course on JavaScript & jQuery.

More details [on their site](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/validating-a-form-with-jquery?ref=lnav).

My solution can also be [viewed in your browser](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-js/blob/master/mint/index.html).
