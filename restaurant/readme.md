#jQuery Restaurant Website

For this assignment, we were asked to build a restaurant's website entirely using Javascript/jQuery, adding just a single DIV to the HTML doc. 

For the background images, I used a handful of photos from Flickr that had various forms of Creative Commons license. They were:
- https://flic.kr/p/dXecW4
- https://flic.kr/p/abUrN6
- https://flic.kr/p/79QfqZ

You can preview the site [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-js-course/blob/master/restaurant/index.html) (not sure why it doubles up when viewed this way, but every student submission for this project does that using the HTMLpreview tool.
