#Tic Tac Toe

For this assignment, we were tasked with taking our earlier command-line version of Tic Tac Toe, written in Ruby, and re-writing it for the web, in JS. More on this assignment on [the Odin Project's site](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/tic-tac-toe).

You can view my game in your browser [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-js-course/blob/master/tictactoe/index.html).

##Update:
On May 2, I updated this game to meet the requirements of FreeCodeCamp's Tic Tac Toe game project. Namely, I added a virtual player. You'll now be asked whether you want to be X or O, and the computer will play the other role.

You can play the updated game on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ubershibs/pen/reQvQw).
