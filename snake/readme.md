#Snake

Completed as part of the Odin Project's course on JavaScript & jQuery.
You can find more details about the assignment [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/jquery-and-the-dom).

To play: Clone this folder (or the whole repo) to your computer and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also try playing on [this preview site](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-js-course/blob/master/snake/index.html), but I find it doubles up some of the jQuery stuff and looks a bit strange.
