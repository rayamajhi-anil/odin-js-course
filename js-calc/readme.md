#JS-Calc

###Update
While I was getting this up and running on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ubershibs/full/vGQWPp/) for a FreeCodeCamp project, I decided I may as well add support for keyboard input. So you can now use the calculator without having to click. I still want/need to work on the graphics a bit when I have some free time. Making the screen flash, etc.

###Read Me
This is a basic calculator I created in response to [this assignment](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/on-screen-calculator) for the Odin Project's JS course. Did this with pure JavaScript, no jQuery.

I've placed a screenshot below, and you can try it out yourself [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-js-course/blob/master/js-calc/index.html), or on CodePen(above).
