#Javascript & jQuery

I built the work in this repository as part of the Odin Project's course on Javascript and JQuery. You can find out more [on their site](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lc-pb).

Projects include:
###The Basics and the Browser
- JS-Calc - an on-screen calculator. Assignment also included a few warmup functions.
- Restaurant - a fake restaurant website. using a single HTML page and jQuery.

###Event, Effects and Widgets
- Snake - just like you had on your old Nokia cell phone. More jQuery practice.
- Slider - image slider/carousel using jQuery.

###Deeper into Javascript
- Tic Tac Toe - more or less porting my earlier Ruby command-line game to the web, in Javascript.
- Minesweeper - learning about the module pattern, closures, and so forth.

###Advanced Browser Work
- Mint - learning about jQuery form validation.
- OMDB - pulling data using Ajax, infinite scroll.

###Linking to APIs and Your Rails Back End
- Google Maps - more API and AJAX fun.
- Waldo - integrating a JS front-end and a Rails backend.

###Server Side Javascript and Javascript Frameworks
- LearnYouNode - worked through the 13 exercises in this Node.js tutorial (the Node project for the Odin Project has yet to be fleshed out.)
