#Slider

I created this photo slider in response to the Odin Project's assignment [found here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/creating-an-image-carousel-slider?ref=lnav). Features:
- Automatically slides after 5 seconds; resta rts at end of reel.
- Hover over left or right side of image to get a prev/next button and preview
- Dots shift along with image. Clicking a dot fast forwards you to that image.
