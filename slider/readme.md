#Slider

I created this photo slider in response to the Odin Project's assignment [found here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/creating-an-image-carousel-slider?ref=lnav). Features:
- Press play to being automatic transitions
- Loops continously, rather than rewinding and restarting when you reach the end/beginning of the set.
- Hover over left or right side of image to get a prev/next button and preview
- Dots shift along with image. Clicking a dot fast forwards you to that image.

You [preview the slider](http://lukewalker.org/odin/js-course/slider/)
